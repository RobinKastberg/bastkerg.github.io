In this task we get a packet capture file and need to answer the following questions:
1. What IP-number does the boss have?
2. What IP-number does the second in command have?
3. How many cells does terrorist group have?
4. Which two terrorist most probably live together?

Starting with with

	tshark -r analytikertestet.pcap -T tabs > analysis

```
    1	  0.000000	10.10.10.117	→	10.10.10.114	TCP	61	10001 → 80 [SYN] Seq=0 Win=8192 Len=7 [TCP segment of a reassembled PDU]
    2	 60.000000	10.10.10.120	→	10.10.10.104	TCP	61	10002 → 80 [SYN] Seq=0 Win=8192 Len=7 [TCP segment of a reassembled PDU]
    3	120.000000	10.10.10.106	→	10.10.10.113	TCP	61	10003 → 80 [SYN] Seq=0 Win=8192 Len=7 [TCP segment of a reassembled PDU]
    4	180.000000	10.10.10.111	→	10.10.10.117	TCP	61	10004 → 80 [SYN] Seq=0 Win=8192 Len=7 [TCP segment of a reassembled PDU]
....
```

Wireshark statistics didn't really help me at all figuring out the questions, so maybe it was more structural.
Wanted to get the data out in a useful format. 
Decided to do a directed graph.
```python
f = open("analysis").readlines()
llst = [r.split("\t") for r in f]
data = [(int(x[2][-2:]), int(x[4][-2:])) for x in llst]

for row in data:
    print(row[0], row[1])
```
Gives me the following data:
```

I entered this on [https://csacademy.com/app/graph_editor/](https://csacademy.com/app/graph_editor/). Which has a useful forcing mode that was very useful.

I got this.

Some massaging gave me this. Now we can easily answer the questions:
